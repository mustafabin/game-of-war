# game-of-war



I modeled the game of War card game based on this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yX-jOVer758) 


Two players evenly split a shuffled deck of 52 standard playing cards. 
Each stack is facedown, and players cannot look at the cards in their stack or rearrange them.
The objective of the game is to play until one player has all 52 cards in their stack.

Players take turns playing the top card from their stacks. 
Whoever's card is a higher value puts both cards at the bottom of their stack.

If there is a tie, then it's War! Each player adds three cards of their stack face down.
Each player reveals their fourth card. Whoever wins that reveal takes all of the cards!
If there is another tie the process repeats until there is a winner.

###  Requirements

- The game starts immediately when the JavaScript is executed. Create your two players and start the rounds!
- There is no user input. The program simply loops through rounds until the game is finished.
- Print a message for each round showing the cards played by each user, who won the round, and how many cards each player has.
- Include a README written in well-formatted Markdown (_hint: look up README templates_)
- Show a good commit history with frequent commits (We're looking for lots of small commits!)
